    "answer": "Certainly! As an International Medical Graduate (IMG) from India aiming to apply for US medical residency, here is the step-by-step process you need to follow:\n\n### 1. **Educational Credentials Verification**\n   - Ensure your medical degree is recognized. Indian MBBS degree is generally accepted if recognized by the Medical Council of India (MCI)/National Medical Commission (NMC).\n   - You will need to have your credentials verified by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG).\n\n### 2. **United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)**\n   - **Step 1:** Basic science knowledge, usually taken before clinical rotations or early in your clinical years or after graduation.\n   - **Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge):** Focus on clinical knowledge.\n   - **Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills):** NOTE: As of 2021, Step 2 CS has been suspended permanently due to COVID-19. Check the latest updates for alternative pathways.\n   - **Step 3:** Taken after matching or during residency; required for full medical licensure.\n\n### 3. **ECFMG Certification**\n   - You must obtain ECFMG Certification to be eligible for residency in the US.\n   - This requires passing USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK, and verification of your medical diploma and transcript.\n   - For details visit: [ECFMG website](https://www.ecfmg.org/)\n\n### 4. **Clinical and Research Experience in the USA (Recommended)**\n   - Pursue clinical observerships, externships, or research to gain US clinical experience.\n   - This improves your residency application and provides letters of recommendation (LoRs).\n\n### 5. **Applying for Residency**\n   - **Register with ERAS:** The Electronic Residency Application Service is the platform through which you apply to residency programs.\n   - **Personal Statement:** Write a strong personal statement.\n   - **Letters of Recommendation (LoRs):** Obtain LoRs, preferably from US physicians.\n   - **MSPE/Dean\u2019s Letter:** Usually sent by your medical school.\n   - **Transcripts:** Official medical transcripts are needed.\n\n### 6. **Residency Match Process through NRMP**\n   - Register for the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) which matches applicants with residency programs.\n   - Rank programs and participate in the Match day process.\n\n### 7. **Visa Requirements**\n   - IMGs typically apply with J-1 or H-1B visas.\n   - Residency programs often sponsor these visas. Ensure you confirm sponsorship availability.\n\n### 8. **Networking and Mentorship**\n   - Contact alumni or physicians from India practicing in the US.\n   - Attend career fairs, webinars, and professional conferences.\n   - Seek mentors to guide you through the application and interview process.\n\n### 9. **Stay Informed**\n   - Follow official websites (ECFMG, NRMP, ERAS).\n   - Stay updated on any changes in exams or residency requirements.\n\n---\n\nDo you want guidance on any specific step such as USMLE preparation, clinical observership opportunities, or application strategies?
