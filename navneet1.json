Do you have any clinical experience or electives in the US or international clinical experience?\n4. Are you aiming for a specific specialty or keeping options open?\n\nMeanwhile, here is a general step-by-step roadmap for IMG admission into US residency programs, usually pursued after graduation:\n\n### Preliminary Roadmap for an IMG (4th Year MBBS Student) Seeking US Residency\n\n**Step 1: Understand Requirements and Planning**\n- Familiarize yourself with USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination) requirements: Step 1, Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge), and Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills) was discontinued as of 2021, replaced by other evaluation methods.\n- Check ECFMG (Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates) certification requirements, which are mandatory before starting residency.\n\n**Step 2: USMLE Exams**\n- Plan and schedule USMLE Step 1 if you haven\u2019t taken it yet. Most IMGs complete Step 1 in medical school\u2019s early years.\n- After Step 1, prepare for Step 2 CK exam, important for clinical knowledge evaluation.\n- Follow updates on ECFMG certification and USMLE requirements.\n\n**Step 3: Clinical Experience**\n- Gain clinical electives, clerkships, or observerships in the US if possible.\n- This experience strengthens your CV and understanding of US healthcare, improves your network, and may lead to Letters of Recommendation (LoRs).\n\n**Step 4: Research and Mentorship**\n- Get involved in medical research in your specialty of interest.\n- Seek mentorship from faculty or senior doctors who understand the US residency system.\n\n**Step 5: ECFMG Certification Application**\n- After passing Step 1 and Step 2 CK, apply for ECFMG certification.\n- ECFMG certification is required to apply to ERAS (Electronic Residency Application Service).\n\n**Step 6: Residency Application**\n- Register for ERAS and prepare your application documents: CV, personal statement, LoRs, transcript, USMLE scores.\n- Apply to programs via ERAS.\n\n**Step 7: Interviews and Match**\n- Prepare for residency interviews.\n- Participate in the NRMP (National Resident Matching Program) match process.\n- After Match Day, follow up on post-Match processes.\n\n---\n\nOnce you clarify your specific goals and status, I can provide a customized roadmap including timelines, exam preparation, clinical opportunities, application strategies, and mentoring advice.\n\nWould you like me to explain the ECFMG certification process and USMLE exams in more detail?"
