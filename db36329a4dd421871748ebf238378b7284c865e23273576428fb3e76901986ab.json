    "question": "I am a MBBS final year student I have a intrest in dermo, suggest me some institutes in USA.",
    "answer": "Thank you for sharing your interest in dermatology. Since you are an MBBS final year student aiming to pursue dermatology in the USA, here are some important steps and information to guide you:\n\n1. **Understanding the Pathway:**\n   - To specialize in dermatology in the USA, you typically need to complete a residency in dermatology after your medical school.\n   - Since you are an International Medical Graduate (IMG), you will first need to clear the USMLE exams (Step 1, Step 2 CK) to be eligible for residency applications.\n   - After passing USMLE Steps 1 and 2 CK, you apply through ERAS for a dermatology residency program.\n\n2. **Dermatology Residency in the USA:**\n   - Dermatology is a highly competitive specialty.\n   - A strong US clinical experience (USCE), good letters of recommendation (LORs) from U.S. physicians, research in dermatology, and a high USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK score will significantly improve your chances.\n   - Some associated fellowships may be available after dermatology residency for further specialization.\n\n3. **Top Dermatology Residency Programs:**\n    Consider preparing a list of programs including but not limited to:\n   - Johns Hopkins University\n   - Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN)\n   - University of Pennsylvania\n   - University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)\n   - Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School\n   - University of Michigan\n   - New York University (NYU)\n   - Stanford University\n   - Cleveland Clinic\n\n4. **Research Opportunities & Networking:**\n   - Try to get involved in dermatology research publications or presentations.\n   - Attend dermatology conferences such as those held by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).\n   - Seek mentorship from dermatologists through professional networking platforms like LinkedIn or through observerships/externships/clerkships in the USA.\n\n5. **Practical Steps Before Residency Application:**\n    - Ensure you have ECFMG certification by passing USMLE Step 1 and 2.\n    - Gain US clinical experience through electives, externships, or observerships in dermatology.\n    - Obtain strong letters of recommendation from US physicians.\n    - Prepare a personal statement emphasizing your passion for dermatology.\n\nWould you like detailed guidance on preparing for and taking USMLE exams or information about clinical observerships and externships in the USA? Also, do you have any US clinical exposure or research experience at this point? This will help me to guide you more specifically."
